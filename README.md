# Architectural-Design-Generator

The Property-Driven Architectural Design Generator is an ML-based system that creates diverse architectural plans based on property data such as lot dimensions and zoning codes. It uses generative techniques like GANs and Variational Autoencoders to propose alternative designs. A validation module ensures compliance with zoning and functional requirements. The system visualizes these designs through simple 2D representations.
